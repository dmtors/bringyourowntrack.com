    </br></br>
    <p><b>Bring Your Own Track</b> is a listening party where attendees bring a track to the gathering for everyone to listen to together in a friendly and welcoming environment.</p>
    </br>
    <p>We meet in public spaces and will broadcast the listening party through our online radio station. This is how everyone will listen to the songs together, through their own headphones. The order of tracks for each listening party is randomly selected. Each artist can determine whether they want feedback or not, or if they would like to share anything about their track. Everyone must be kind, considerate, and respectful of everyone participating.</p>
    </br>
    <p>This is a great way to meet other artists in the area, discover new music and audible art, and get your own tracks out there for others to hear.</p>

    </br></br>
    <p><b>What counts as a track?</b></p>
    <p>A track can be anything from a song, poem, spoken word, or anything else created sonically and is less than 5ish minutes long (we ask that your piece is in a somewhat complete state, meaning not just a riff or one verse)</p>
    </br>
    <p><b>Does it cost anything?</b></p>
    <p>No, this is free.</p>
    </br>
    <p><b>Can I attend if I don't submit a track?</b></p>
    <p>At this time, no. But you can listen to the playlist for each listening party once it is released.</p>
    </br>
